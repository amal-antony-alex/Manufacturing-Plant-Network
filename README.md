# Manufacturing Plant Network  
**Minor Project – B.Tech (CSE - CSCD)**  
Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Sri Sri University

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This minor project focuses on the **design and simulation of a secure, scalable, and high-performance network infrastructure for a modern manufacturing plant**.  
The network is modeled using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and follows a **three-tier hierarchical architecture** consisting of Core, Distribution, and Access layers.

The design emphasizes **network segmentation, cybersecurity, redundancy, and future scalability**, aligning with **Industry 4.0** requirements.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a secure and scalable manufacturing plant network
- Implement VLAN-based segmentation for different operational zones
- Ensure high availability using redundancy and dual ISP connectivity
- Apply cybersecurity mechanisms such as ACLs, firewalls, SSH, and port security
- Simulate real-world enterprise and OT (Operational Technology) environments

---

## 🏭 Network Zones Implemented
- Guest & Reception Zone  
- Production Zone  
- Engineering Zone  
- Corporate Zone  
- Storage Zone  
- Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

Each zone is isolated using **dedicated VLANs and subnets** to enhance security and traffic management.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Routing Protocol:** OSPF
- **Switching:** VLANs, Trunking
- **Security:**  
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
  - Firewalls  
  - Port Security (Sticky MAC)  
  - SSH (Secure Shell)  
- **IP Management:** DHCP, Static IPs
- **NAT:** PAT (NAT Overload)
- **Monitoring:** SNMP, Logging

---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture
- **Core Layer:** Redundant core routers connected to dual ISPs  
- **Distribution Layer:** Multilayer switches for inter-VLAN routing  
- **Access Layer:** Access switches and wireless APs for end devices  

The architecture ensures **fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient management**.
